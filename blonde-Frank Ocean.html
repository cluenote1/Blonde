                                      What's the most amazing thing you've ever witnessed?\n

                                      Maybe we can get a little— a little bit, little bit, little bit\n\n
                                      I wish I could sleep without, like, being dead\n
                                      But forever at the same time\n\n
                                      Yo, what, what's, what's the year 3000 going to look like? (Dog, stop, stop, what you mean, bro? Stop, stop)\n\n
                                      Or it could be great and shit can fly\n
                                      And buildings would be very, very tall and everybody won't know what the ground looks like\n\n
                                      That's fucked up\n
                                      (Excuse me)\n\n

                                      Being Drake\n\n
                                      I think a lot, a lot, too much\n
                                      Sometimes I'm very musty\n\n
                                      Talents, got any secret talents?\n\n
                                      I don't think so, I'm pretty open with all, everything that I do\n\n
                                      Talents? Um, I can play the theremin\n\n
                                      Probably my brother, just to see how much work he has in one day\n\n
                                      Probably, uh, probably Tyler, his life seems pretty awesome\n
                                      No, actually, no, fuck him uh\n
                                      I don't know\n
                                      Probably Dill, 'cause he doesn't have to do anything at all\n
                                      Just sits inside his house\n\n
                                      What's your name?\n\n

                                      Probably jump off something really high\n
                                      Super high and try to land in like a handstand or something\n\n
                                      Alright, that's it\n\n
                                      I don't know, there would be a lot of things I'll do\n
                                      Probably spend a lot of time with my family\n\n
                                      Spend a couple hours with my family and I would go out and do like everything that I ever thought about trying\n\n
                                      I don't know, there's a lot of things that you could do\n
                                      That's it\n\n
